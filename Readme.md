# Sample Database - Indexing Article

This is a sample orders database table with 3.5 million records, allowing readers of the MakeUseOf.com article (link forthcoming) to follow along with the examples.  You may install this table on your local machine with the following commands.

    git clone https://github.com/mdizak/sample-index-db.git
    cd sample-index-db
    sudo mysql < orders.sql

You will then have a new "sampledb" database that contains one table named "orders".
